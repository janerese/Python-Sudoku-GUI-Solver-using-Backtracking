# Sudoku-Solver-using-Backtracking-in-Python

For this project, I followed the code by PasiduPerera in this webpage titled ["Sudoku Solver-Python using Backtracking"](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/sudoku-solver-python-using-backtracking-1aff17a3340) to create a Sudoku Solver using Backtracking Algorithm in Python.

> Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).

Here are the modifications to the code that I applied:
- Transformed the print result from a **list type** to a **typical 9x9 Sudoku Board**.
- Implemented a Sudoku Game in Python with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using *pygame*.
- Changed some parts of the code to make the GUI work properly.
